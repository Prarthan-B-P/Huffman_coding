# Huffman_coding

Huffman Coding Algorithm
📜 Description
This project implements the Huffman Coding algorithm, a widely-used technique for data compression. Huffman Coding reduces file sizes by assigning shorter binary codes to frequently occurring characters and longer codes to less frequent ones.

The implementation includes:

A Huffman Tree built using character frequencies.
Encoding a text message into a compressed binary representation.
Decoding the binary representation back into the original text.
🚀 Features
Efficient text compression using priority queues.
Custom binary codes for each character based on frequency.
Two-way functionality: Encoding and Decoding.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: C++
Data Structures: Binary Trees, Priority Queues, Hash Maps
📂 File Structure
main.cpp: The main implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm.
README.md: Project description and setup instructions.
🔧 How to Run
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/huffman-coding.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd huffman-coding
Compile and run the program:
bash
Copy code
g++ main.cpp -o huffman && ./huffman
Enter the message you want to compress when prompted.
📊 Example
Input:

bash
Copy code
Enter the message you want to hash: hello world  
Output:

makefile
Copy code
Encoded: 101010011110011...  
Decoded: hello world  
🌟 Future Enhancements
Add support for file compression and decompression.
Optimize further for large datasets.
Implement a GUI for ease of use.
